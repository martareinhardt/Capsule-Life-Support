## üéØ Executive Summary and Viability Status

This project demonstrates the engineering viability of a Multi-Layer Adaptive Capsule designed to protect an astronaut under extreme conditions, including **10G** acceleration.

The engineering simulations were validated via GitHub Actions, confirming **SUCCESS** in all critical life support aspects:

| Risk Area | Initial Condition | Final Result | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **G-Force** | 10.0 G | 1.75 G | ‚úÖ SUCCESS |
| **Radiation** | 500 mSv | 47.50 mSv | ‚úÖ SUCCESS |
| **Thermal** | 80.0 ¬∞C (External) | 3.28 ¬∞C (Internal) | ‚úÖ SUCCESS |

## üî¨ Visual Proof of Viability

The following charts visually confirm that the final simulated values are well within the required safety limits for each system.

### 1. G-Force: Reduction from 10G to 1.75G

The damping system successfully reduces the G-Force to 1.75 G, significantly below the tolerable limit of 5G.

### 2. Radiation: Below the Safety Limit

The shield reduces the absorbed dose to 47.50 mSv, maintaining safety well under the NASA limit of 50 mSv.

### 3. Thermal Stability: Maintained within Cryogenic Range

The capsule's 99% insulation maintains the internal temperature at 3.28 ¬∞C, confirming successful cryo-stability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Architecture and Automation

The project follows an automated, best-practice engineering workflow:

* **Detailed Technical Reports:** Find all engineering premises, equations, and numerical results in the **[Simulations/README.md](./Simulations/README.md)** file.
* **Source Code Locations:**
    * **Calculations:** `Simulations/`
    * **Visualizations:** `Visualizations/`
* **Automation:** The **`.github/workflows/run_g_force.yml`** workflow ensures all simulations and charts are executed and validated automatically upon every code change.
